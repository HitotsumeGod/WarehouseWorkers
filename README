Concept

Warehouse Workers is a project that simulates a virtual work environment within a warehouse with two different production tracks: one for boxes, and one for bundles. 
Each track is outfitted with a single Builder worker (which systematically assembles either boxes or bundles) and a single Terminator worker (which systematically assembles either boxes or bundles).
The entire warehouse is overseen by a Scribe worker, which records all changes in the warehouse, and updates its findings as fast as possible.
This project serves as a proof-of-ability for the creator, Peter, in relation to the following Java Programming Skills:

Multithreading & Concurrency (each worker is its own individual thread)
Encapsulation (each class is aware only of the bare minimum to run)

Instructions

Warehouse Workers requires the Apache Ant build tool to be used effectively. Once acquired, the following commands become available.

'ant compile' <---- Compiles all code and prepares the program for execution.
'ant run' <---- Executes the program.

At any time during program execution, the capital letter 'K' may be input in order to immediately terminate all threads. This is a part of the core program, and not an Ant task.
